* Objectives 
  The purpose of this lab is develop a JPEG Encoder / Decoder unit for SoC. 

* Theory
There are 4 stages of JPEG compression and JPEG decompression. These 4 stages are DCT, Quantization, Zig Zag and Entropy Encoding. 

For this lab we were reponsible for just DCT, Quantization and Zig Zag. 

** Compression 
Before the image is applied with DCT it must be first pre-processed. The It is preprocessed by
dividing image into 8x8 blocks. The image is also level-shifted so that the frequency domain of the
data moves to the right of the origin. Level shifting is done by substracting 128 from each pixel.
Each 8x8 block has DCT applied to it, thus making each 8x8 block of image data into a 8x8 block
of frequencies or sum of cosines.
The following equation is used for DCT 


Each 8x8 block has DCT applied to it, thus making each 8x8 block of image data into a 8x8 block of frequencies or sum of cosines.  

\begin{equation}  
a + b \sqrt{5}
\end{equation}


Next the Quantizer is applied to get rid of the higher frequency wave forms (since they are not needed) and keeps the lower frequency waveforms since they represent the majority of the image.  

Next the ZigZag converts each 8x8 block char array into a 1x64 char array.  

The output is a compressed file (without Huffman Encoding) that is in a character format, not a double. In compression you are writing char, not double to a file,  
since char is a useful data type in the fact that it has a fixed size on multiple machines, whereas different data types may have different sizes on different 
machines. 

** Decompression 

For decompression, the above method is utilized but in reverse, the 1x64 array is unzigzagged, from 1x64 to 8x8. Then the quantizer table is multiplied to each
block, instead of being divided by it. 
After being unquantized, IDCT is then applied to each 8x8 block, thus bringing back the original image.

The reason as to why the image is of lesser quality is due to the fact that is has been initially quantized when it was compressed. Quantization is a lossy process 
 therefore some data will be lost during the compression. 

However, if quantization was not used and just zigzag and DCT were used, since there are lossless processes, when compressed and uncompressed, the output will be the 
same as the original.
